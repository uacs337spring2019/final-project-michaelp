      <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
      <p class="text">Eller Hispanic Honorary was organized to foster the talent and academic excellence among
        the finest Hispanic business students in the Eller College of Management; to culturally unite and welcome diversity; to promote scholarship and
        outstanding academic achievement; to bridge affiliation with the commercial world and the Eller Hispanic Honorary members; and to significantly
        ensure extraordinary leadership in the commercial world headed by the top Hispanic business graduates who are produced by the Eller College of
        Management at the University of Arizona.</p>

      <h1>Our story</h1>
      <p class="text">Eller Hispanic Honorary was started by Stephanie Monta√±o, Sarai Portillo, Paul Perez, Alejandra Borbon, Diana Cook, and Roy Saenz in 2012. At the time, there wasn't an organization
         to celebrate Latino students exceeding in Eller. Our main event is the Eller Top 50 Hispanics Dinner where we honor the top Latino students for their hard work and perseverance. We also
         started Eller Insights which is a program to help incoming community college students have a smoother transition into the Eller College. In 2017, we were able to introduce the EHH scholarship
         fund to give back to the Eller community. Every semester, the club gets the chance to see its community grow, once starting with 6 members now has over 55 active members.</p>
